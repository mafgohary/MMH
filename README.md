Mohamed Elgohary, a PhD Candidate at Politecnico di Milano, Department of Architecture and Urban Studies, develops this code. 
The code aims to prepare an OSM and GTFS data into a Node/Place model that would capture Multimodality. 
The code starts with re-adapting the ABC Location Policy to spot potential space for multimodal huns along public transport and car infrastructure. 
Then, the code implies several components on 
1. Multimodality
2. Accessibility
3. Public transport
4. Shared mobility
5. Bike sharing
6. Physical conditions
and for what concern place dimension, it works on Census data of population, and IAPI index (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275123003931)
